# MLOps & Agentic AI — Learning Guide
> Use this guide with the course videos. Concepts are mapped to the code in this repo.

---

## Using This Guide
1. Watch the module video first
2. Read the concept section below
3. Open the referenced file and locate the code
4. Run it to verify behavior

---

## Module 1 — MLOps Fundamentals
**Video:** https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NgWujOrCZFo
**Problem:** ML systems fail without structured lifecycle management.

### What is MLOps?
MLOps = DevOps principles applied to Machine Learning.
Without MLOps, teams face:
- "It worked on my machine" — no reproducibility
- Models deployed manually — error-prone and slow
- No monitoring — model quality degrades silently
- No versioning — can't rollback a bad model

### The ML Lifecycle (what we automated)
```
Data → Train → Evaluate → Package → Deploy → Monitor → Retrain
```

### Maturity Levels
| Level | Description | This Project |
|-------|-------------|-------------|
| 0 | Manual everything | — |
| 1 | Automated pipeline | docker-compose.yml |
| 2 | Full CI/CD | .github/workflows/deploy.yml |

### In Our Code
- `docker-compose.yml` — defines the full system as code (infrastructure as code)
- `.github/workflows/deploy.yml` — automates the entire deploy lifecycle
- `Makefile` — standardizes all commands so any team member can run them

---

## Module 2 — Data Versioning (DVC)
**Problem:** Training data changes break reproducibility.

### Why Data Versioning Matters
Code is versioned with Git. But what about data?
- You train model v1 on dataset A → accuracy 90%
- Dataset A gets updated → you retrain → accuracy drops to 80%
- You can't go back because you didn't version the data

### DVC (Data Version Control)
DVC tracks large files (datasets, models) in Git without storing them in Git.
It stores a small `.dvc` pointer file in Git and the actual data in S3/GCS.

```bash
# How DVC works
dvc init                          # initialize DVC in project
dvc add data/train.csv            # track dataset
git add data/train.csv.dvc        # commit the pointer
dvc push                          # upload actual data to S3
dvc pull                          # download data by version
dvc repro                         # reproduce pipeline from scratch
```

### In Our Code
Our `data/` folder holds the RAG knowledge base.
In a full MLOps setup, all data files would be versioned with DVC:
```
data/mlops_docs.txt      →  tracked by DVC
data/mlops_docs.txt.dvc  →  committed to Git (small pointer file)
```
The assistant also has real DVC documentation fetched from dvc.org (`data/dvc_start.txt`, `data/dvc_pipeline.txt`). Ask it: *"How do I create a DVC pipeline?"*

---

## Module 3 — Experiment Tracking (MLflow)
**Video:** https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86BKEv0X2xU
**Problem:** Experiments are lost without tracking.

### Why Experiment Tracking Matters
When training ML models, you run many experiments:
- Experiment 1: learning_rate=0.01, accuracy=85%
- Experiment 2: learning_rate=0.001, accuracy=91%
- Experiment 3: n_estimators=200, accuracy=93%

Without tracking, you forget what worked and why.

### MLflow Core API
```python
import mlflow

# Start tracking an experiment run
with mlflow.start_run(run_name="random_forest_v1"):

    # Log hyperparameters
    mlflow.log_param("n_estimators", 100)
    mlflow.log_param("max_depth", 5)
    mlflow.log_param("learning_rate", 0.01)

    # Train your model here...
    # model = train(...)

    # Log results/metrics
    mlflow.log_metric("accuracy", 0.93)
    mlflow.log_metric("f1_score", 0.91)
    mlflow.log_metric("loss", 0.07)

    # Log the model itself
    mlflow.sklearn.log_model(model, "model")
    mlflow.log_artifact("confusion_matrix.png")

# View all runs: mlflow ui → http://localhost:5000
```

### Key MLflow Concepts
| Concept | What it is |
|---------|-----------|
| Run | One training execution with its params + metrics |
| Experiment | Group of related runs |
| Artifact | Files saved with a run (model, plots, data) |
| Metric | Numeric value tracked over time (loss, accuracy) |
| Parameter | Input config to your training (learning rate, epochs) |

### In Our Code
Real MLflow docs are indexed in the knowledge base (`data/mlflow_readme.txt`, `data/mlflow_concepts.txt`).
Ask the assistant: *"Show me how to log a PyTorch model with MLflow"*

---

## Module 4 — Model Registry (MLflow)
**Problem:** No governance over deployed models.

### The Problem Without a Registry
- Developer A trains a model and deploys it directly to production
- No one knows which version is running
- Can't rollback when the model performs badly
- No approval process before deployment

### MLflow Model Registry — Stages
```
None → Staging → Production → Archived
```

```python
from mlflow.tracking import MlflowClient

client = MlflowClient()

# Register a model from a run
mlflow.register_model(
    model_uri="runs:/abc123/model",
    name="customer_churn_model"
)

# Promote to Staging for testing
client.transition_model_version_stage(
    name="customer_churn_model",
    version=1,
    stage="Staging"
)

# After testing passes, promote to Production
client.transition_model_version_stage(
    name="customer_churn_model",
    version=1,
    stage="Production"
)

# Get the current production model
model = mlflow.sklearn.load_model(
    model_uri="models:/customer_churn_model/Production"
)
```

---

## Module 5 — Training Pipelines (Kubeflow)
**Video:** https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5iOQcGfcZe4
**Problem:** Manual training is not scalable.

### Why Pipelines Matter
Manual training process:
1. Engineer SSHes into a server
2. Runs a Python script
3. Waits hours
4. Manually copies the model file
5. Deploys by hand

This doesn't scale. Pipelines automate every step.

### Kubeflow Pipelines
Kubeflow runs on Kubernetes. Each step is a Docker container.

```python
from kfp import dsl

# Each function becomes a container in the pipeline
@dsl.component
def preprocess_data(input_path: str, output_path: dsl.OutputPath()):
    import pandas as pd
    df = pd.read_csv(input_path)
    # ... preprocessing ...
    df.to_csv(output_path, index=False)

@dsl.component
def train_model(data_path: dsl.InputPath(), model_path: dsl.OutputPath()):
    # ... training ...
    pass

@dsl.component
def evaluate_model(model_path: dsl.InputPath()) -> float:
    # ... evaluation ...
    return accuracy

# Define the pipeline — steps run in order
@dsl.pipeline(name="ML Training Pipeline")
def ml_pipeline(input_data: str = "gs://bucket/data.csv"):
    preprocess = preprocess_data(input_path=input_data)
    train = train_model(data_path=preprocess.output)
    evaluate = evaluate_model(model_path=train.output)
```

### In Our Code
Real Kubeflow docs are in the knowledge base (`data/kubeflow_pipelines.txt`, `data/kubeflow_intro.txt`).
Ask: *"What is the difference between Kubeflow and Argo Workflows?"*

---

## Module 6 — Model Serving (KServe)
**Problem:** Ad-hoc serving lacks scalability.

### KServe on Kubernetes
KServe provides production-grade model serving with:
- Auto-scaling (scale up under load, scale to zero when idle)
- Multiple framework support (sklearn, PyTorch, TensorFlow, ONNX)
- Canary deployments (route 10% traffic to new model, 90% to old)
- A/B testing

```yaml
# Deploy a model with KServe (Kubernetes YAML)
apiVersion: serving.kserve.io/v1beta1
kind: InferenceService
metadata:
  name: customer-churn-model
spec:
  predictor:
    sklearn:
      storageUri: "s3://my-bucket/models/churn/v2"
    # Auto-scaling config
    minReplicas: 1
    maxReplicas: 10
```

```bash
# Make a prediction
curl -X POST http://model-endpoint/v1/models/customer-churn-model:predict \
  -d '{"instances": [[0.5, 1.2, 3.4, 0.1]]}'
```

### In Our Code
Real KServe docs are indexed (`data/kserve_overview.txt`, `data/kserve_concepts.txt`).
Ask: *"How do I do canary deployment with KServe?"*

---

## Module 7 — CI/CD for ML (GitHub Actions)
**Problem:** ML changes need controlled releases.
**In our code:** `.github/workflows/deploy.yml`

### What CI/CD Does
**CI (Continuous Integration):** Every code push runs tests automatically.
**CD (Continuous Deployment):** If tests pass, deploy automatically.

### Our Pipeline — `deploy.yml`
```
Developer pushes code to GitHub
    ↓
[Job 1 - CI] GitHub spins up Ubuntu VM
    → installs Python + dependencies
    → runs: pytest tests/ -v
    → if ANY test fails → pipeline STOPS here
    ↓ (all tests pass)
[Job 2 - CD] SSH into EC2
    → git pull latest code
    → write .env from GitHub Secrets (API keys never in git)
    → docker compose up --build -d
    → verify containers running
    ↓
App is live with new code
```

### Key Concepts in `deploy.yml`

**Triggers:**
```yaml
on:
  push:
    branches: [main]      # runs when you push to main
  pull_request:
    branches: [main]      # runs on PRs (CI only, not CD)
```

**Secrets** (Module 9 — Security):
```yaml
# Never hardcode secrets in code
# Store in GitHub Settings → Secrets → Actions
env:
  OPENROUTER_API_KEY: ${{ secrets.OPENROUTER_API_KEY }}
```

**Job dependencies:**
```yaml
deploy:
  needs: test    # deploy only runs AFTER test passes
```

### Our Tests — `tests/test_api.py`
```python
# 10 tests that run in CI
def test_health_check():                    # is the server up?
def test_history_empty_for_new_session():   # does memory work?
def test_chat_endpoint_exists():            # does /chat respond?
# ... 7 more tests
```

---

## Module 8 — Monitoring & Drift Detection
**Problem:** Model quality degrades silently.

### Types of Drift
| Type | What happens | Example |
|------|-------------|---------|
| Data Drift | Input distribution changes | Users start using new slang the model never saw |
| Concept Drift | Input→Output relationship changes | Economic conditions change, old patterns don't hold |
| Prediction Drift | Model output distribution changes | Model starts predicting one class more than others |

### How to Detect Drift
```python
# Using Evidently AI (popular open-source tool)
from evidently.report import Report
from evidently.metric_preset import DataDriftPreset

report = Report(metrics=[DataDriftPreset()])
report.run(
    reference_data=train_df,    # what model trained on
    current_data=production_df  # what model sees in production
)
report.save_html("drift_report.html")
```

### Key Metrics to Monitor
- **Model accuracy** — compare live accuracy to baseline
- **Feature statistics** — mean, std dev, min, max of input features
- **Prediction confidence** — are predictions becoming less confident?
- **Data quality** — missing values, outliers, schema violations

---

## Module 9 — Security & Governance
**Problem:** Unsecured ML assets risk compliance.

### In Our Code — Security Practices

**1. Secrets never in code:**
```bash
# BAD — never do this
OPENROUTER_API_KEY = "sk-or-v1-abc123..."

# GOOD — read from environment
OPENROUTER_API_KEY = os.getenv("OPENROUTER_API_KEY")
```

**2. `.env` excluded from git:**
```
# .dockerignore and .gitignore
.env
.env.*
!.env.example   # only the template is committed
```

**3. GitHub Secrets for CI/CD:**
- `EC2_SSH_KEY` — private key never in code
- `OPENROUTER_API_KEY` — injected at deploy time

**4. IAM Least Privilege (AWS):**
- EC2 instance should only have permissions it needs
- No admin access — only specific S3 buckets, specific ECR repos

---

## Module 10 — LLM & Agentic AI Basics
**Video:** https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jGg_1h0qzaM
**Problem:** Chatbots fail to reason or take actions autonomously.
**In our code:** `agent.py`

### What is an LLM Agent?
A regular chatbot: User → LLM → Answer (one shot, no tools)

An Agent: User → LLM → decides to use a tool → tool runs → result → LLM → better answer

### ReAct Pattern (Reasoning + Acting)
```
User: "What MLflow commands do I use for experiment tracking?"

Agent Thought: "I should search the knowledge base for MLflow tracking info"
Agent Action:  search_mlops_docs("MLflow tracking commands")
Observation:   "mlflow.log_param(), mlflow.log_metric(), mlflow.start_run()..."
Agent Thought: "I have the info, I can now answer"
Agent Answer:  "Here are the MLflow tracking commands: ..."
```

This loop (Thought → Action → Observation) repeats until the agent has enough to answer.

### OpenRouter
OpenRouter is a single API that gives you access to 100+ LLMs:
- GPT-4o, GPT-4o-mini (OpenAI)
- Claude 3.5 Sonnet (Anthropic)
- Llama 3.1 (Meta)
- Gemini (Google)
- Mistral, Mixtral

```python
# config.py — OpenRouter setup
OPENROUTER_BASE_URL = "https://openrouter.ai/api/v1"
MODEL_NAME = "openai/gpt-4o-mini"

# agent.py — using OpenRouter via LangChain
from langchain_openai import ChatOpenAI

llm = ChatOpenAI(
    model=MODEL_NAME,
    api_key=OPENROUTER_API_KEY,
    base_url=OPENROUTER_BASE_URL,
)
```

---

## Module 11 — Python for Agents (FastAPI)
**Video:** https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rvFsGRvj9jo
**Problem:** Agents need reliable backend APIs.
**In our code:** `main.py`

### Why FastAPI?
| Feature | Benefit |
|---------|---------|
| Auto docs at `/docs` | No manual documentation |
| Pydantic validation | Bad requests rejected automatically |
| Async/await | Handle many requests concurrently |
| Type hints | Fewer bugs, better IDE support |

### Key FastAPI Concepts in `main.py`

**Pydantic Models (input validation):**
```python
class ChatRequest(BaseModel):
    message: str                    # required
    session_id: str = "default"     # optional, defaults to "default"

# FastAPI automatically validates:
# - message must be a string
# - Returns 422 Unprocessable Entity if message is missing
```

**Async endpoint (non-blocking):**
```python
@app.post("/chat", response_model=ChatResponse)
async def chat(request: ChatRequest):
    # await = non-blocking, FastAPI handles other requests while waiting
    result = await agent.ainvoke({"messages": messages_in})
    return ChatResponse(response=result["messages"][-1].content)
```

**Session Memory (per-user conversation history):**
```python
from collections import defaultdict
session_store: dict[str, list[BaseMessage]] = defaultdict(list)

# Each session_id gets its own conversation history
# "user-A" and "user-B" have completely separate conversations
# Same session_id = agent remembers your previous messages
```

### All Endpoints
| Method | Endpoint | What it does |
|--------|----------|-------------|
| GET | `/` | Welcome message |
| GET | `/health` | Health check for load balancer |
| POST | `/chat` | LangGraph agent chat |
| POST | `/crew-chat` | CrewAI multi-agent chat |
| GET | `/history/{id}` | Get conversation history |
| DELETE | `/history/{id}` | Clear session |
| POST | `/index-docs` | Re-index RAG documents |
| GET | `/docs` | Swagger UI (auto-generated) |

---

## Module 12 — Agent Frameworks (LangGraph + CrewAI)
**Problem:** Manual orchestration of agent logic is error-prone.
**In our code:** `agent.py` (LangGraph), `crew.py` (CrewAI)

### LangGraph — `agent.py`
LangGraph models the agent as a **directed graph** with nodes and edges.

```
State: { messages: [...] }
         ↓
    [llm node]          ← calls OpenRouter LLM
         ↓
  tool call? ──Yes──→ [tools node]   ← runs search_mlops_docs or calculate
     ↓ No                   ↓
    END              back to [llm node]
```

```python
# agent.py — the complete LangGraph setup

# 1. Define state (what the graph tracks)
class AgentState(TypedDict):
    messages: Annotated[list[BaseMessage], operator.add]
    # operator.add means new messages are APPENDED (not replaced)

# 2. Define the LLM node
def call_llm(state: AgentState) -> dict:
    response = llm.invoke([SystemMessage(...)] + state["messages"])
    return {"messages": [response]}

# 3. Build the graph
graph = StateGraph(AgentState)
graph.add_node("llm", call_llm)           # node 1: LLM
graph.add_node("tools", ToolNode(tools))  # node 2: tool executor

graph.set_entry_point("llm")
graph.add_conditional_edges("llm", tools_condition)
# tools_condition: if LLM called a tool → go to tools, else → END
graph.add_edge("tools", "llm")            # after tools, always back to LLM

agent = graph.compile()
```

### CrewAI — `crew.py`
CrewAI is for **multiple specialized agents** collaborating.

```python
# crew.py — two agents work as a team

# Agent 1: Researcher — searches knowledge base
researcher = Agent(
    role="MLOps Research Specialist",
    goal="Search the knowledge base and gather accurate information",
    tools=[search_tool],   # has access to RAG search
    llm=llm,
)

# Agent 2: Writer — explains the findings
writer = Agent(
    role="MLOps Technical Writer",
    goal="Transform research into clear explanations",
    llm=llm,
    # no tools — just writes based on researcher's findings
)

# Task 1: Research
research_task = Task(
    description="Search and gather info about: {question}",
    agent=researcher,
)

# Task 2: Write (receives research as context)
writing_task = Task(
    description="Write a clear answer based on research",
    agent=writer,
    context=[research_task],   # ← gets researcher's output
)

# Crew runs them sequentially
crew = Crew(
    agents=[researcher, writer],
    tasks=[research_task, writing_task],
    process=Process.sequential,
)
result = crew.kickoff()
```

### When to Use Which?
| Scenario | Use |
|----------|-----|
| Single agent, complex reasoning with tools | LangGraph |
| Multiple specialized agents collaborating | CrewAI |
| Fine-grained control over flow | LangGraph |
| Role-based agent teams | CrewAI |

Real LangGraph and CrewAI docs are indexed in the knowledge base. Ask:
- *"What are LangGraph edges and how do conditional edges work?"*
- *"How do I add memory to a CrewAI agent?"*

---

## Module 13 — RAG Systems
**Problem:** LLMs hallucinate without grounding in enterprise data.
**In our code:** `rag.py`, `ingest_web.py`

### What is RAG?
RAG = Retrieval-Augmented Generation

Without RAG:
```
User: "What is the MLflow command for logging a model?"
LLM:  "You can use mlflow.model.save() ..."   ← WRONG (hallucinated)
```

With RAG:
```
User: "What is the MLflow command for logging a model?"
RAG:  searches docs → finds "mlflow.sklearn.log_model(model, 'name')"
LLM:  "Use mlflow.sklearn.log_model(model, 'name') ..."   ← CORRECT
```

### RAG Pipeline — Two Phases

**Phase 1: Indexing (done once at startup)**
```python
# rag.py — load_and_index_documents()

# Step 1: Load documents from data/ folder
loader = DirectoryLoader("./data", glob="*.txt",
                         loader_cls=TextLoader,
                         loader_kwargs={"encoding": "utf-8"})
documents = loader.load()   # loads all 21 .txt files

# Step 2: Split into chunks (500 chars each, 50 overlap)
splitter = RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter(chunk_size=500, chunk_overlap=50)
chunks = splitter.split_documents(documents)

# Step 3: Embed each chunk (convert text → number vectors)
embeddings = HuggingFaceEmbeddings(model_name="all-MiniLM-L6-v2")

# Step 4: Store in ChromaDB (vector database on disk)
vectorstore = Chroma.from_documents(chunks, embeddings,
                                    persist_directory="./chroma_db")
```

**Phase 2: Retrieval (done on every query)**
```python
# rag.py — get_retriever()

# User asks a question → embed it → find similar chunks
retriever = vectorstore.as_retriever(search_kwargs={"k": 3})

# Under the hood:
# 1. Embed the query: "how does MLflow work?" → [0.2, 0.8, 0.1, ...]
# 2. Find top-3 most similar chunks in ChromaDB
# 3. Return those chunks as context for the LLM
```

### Enriching with Internet Data — `ingest_web.py`
The knowledge base is not just static text. `ingest_web.py` fetches real documentation from official sources:

```python
# ingest_web.py — sources configured
SOURCES = {
    "mlflow":   [("mlflow_readme.txt", "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mlflow/mlflow/master/README.md", ...)],
    "dvc":      [("dvc_start.txt", "https://dvc.org/doc/start", ...)],
    "kubeflow": [...],
    "kserve":   [...],
    "langgraph":[...],
    "crewai":   [...],   # 27k+ chars of real CrewAI agent docs
    "fastapi":  [...],   # 14k+ chars of real FastAPI docs
    "chromadb": [...],
    # ...10 sources total, 20 pages
}
```

```bash
# Fetch all internet docs and save to data/
python ingest_web.py

# Re-index ChromaDB with new data
curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/index-docs
```

### Key RAG Components
| Component | What it does | In our code |
|-----------|-------------|-------------|
| Document Loader | Reads files from disk | `DirectoryLoader` with utf-8 encoding |
| Text Splitter | Breaks docs into chunks | `RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter(500, 50)` |
| Embeddings | Converts text to vectors | `HuggingFaceEmbeddings` (local, free) |
| Vector Store | Stores + searches vectors | `ChromaDB` (persisted to `./chroma_db`) |
| Retriever | Finds relevant chunks | `vectorstore.as_retriever(k=3)` |
| Web Ingestion | Fetches real docs | `ingest_web.py` (requests + BeautifulSoup) |

### Why Chunk Size Matters
- Too small (100 chars) → chunks lose context
- Too large (2000 chars) → retrieval is imprecise, too much noise
- 500 chars with 50 overlap = good balance for technical documentation

---

## Docker — Containerization
**In our code:** `Dockerfile.api`, `Dockerfile.ui`, `docker-compose.yml`

### Why Docker?
"It works on my machine" → Docker makes it work on EVERY machine.
A container packages the app + its dependencies + the runtime together.

### `Dockerfile.api` — Multi-stage Build
```dockerfile
# Stage 1: Builder — install dependencies
FROM python:3.12-slim AS builder
RUN pip install -r requirements.txt
# Pre-download HuggingFace model (so container starts fast)
RUN python -c "from sentence_transformers import SentenceTransformer; SentenceTransformer('all-MiniLM-L6-v2')"

# Stage 2: Runtime — only copy what's needed (smaller image)
FROM python:3.12-slim
COPY --from=builder /root/.local /root/.local
COPY *.py ./
CMD ["uvicorn", "main:app", "--host", "0.0.0.0", "--port", "8000"]
```

### `docker-compose.yml` — Multi-container
```yaml
services:
  api:                     # FastAPI container
    build: Dockerfile.api
    ports: ["8000:8000"]
    volumes:
      - chroma_data:/app/chroma_db   # persist data across restarts

  ui:                      # Streamlit container
    build: Dockerfile.ui
    environment:
      - API_URL=http://api:8000      # ui talks to api by container name
    depends_on:
      api:
        condition: service_healthy   # wait for API health check to pass
```
